Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Michael Bork, I come from Oberhausen (Germany) and am currently taking part in a retraining course to become an IT specialist in application development at ComCave College.

Since I don't always want to be dependent on external developers for my server, this is the best step for me.

I'm here to learn, get support and help.
